         C UID& id        ()C {return _id   ;} // get object's id, 'id' is a unique identifier different than 'UIDZero' for valid objects, and 'UIDZero' for invalid objects (invalid object is an object which has been removed/deleted), id's are randomly generated upon object creation (in World Editor or dynamically in the game), they are stored in SaveGame so object's id is restored when loaded
   virtual Bool canBeSaved()  {return  true ;} // if  object wants to be saved, you can override this method and return false when object is useless and doesn't need to be stored in a SaveGame. This method is also called for objects in worlds initialized with WORLD_FULL, when objects enter new areas (that were not yet created), the engine will call this method and place the object in that area only if 'canBeSaved' will return true, in other case the object will get deleted, WORLD_FULL doesn't impose any limits to the number of areas created, that's why you can use this method to make sure that objects will not travel to very distant areas.
   virtual Obj* reliesOn  ()  {return  null ;} // you can override this method and optionally return an object on which the current object relies on, this will make the WorldManager to try to update the returned object before the current one, this can be useful for example in situation when animation of object A is dependent on animation of object B, for example if player is riding a horse, then horse animations must be setup first (horse must be updated before player) so animating player can be done basing on the position of the horse, in this situation the player class should override 'reliesOn' method and return the horse object, so that horse will be updated first

   virtual void drawOutline () {}    // in this method you should draw custom objects for the RM_OUTLINE  mode, this method will be called only if the 'drawPrepare' has requested RM_OUTLINE  mode
