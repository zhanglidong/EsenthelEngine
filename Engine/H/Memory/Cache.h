/******************************************************************************

   Use 'Cache' to quickly access custom data by loading it from specified file.
      Once 'Cache' loads a resource, it will keep it in the memory for faster access.
      You can also use 'Cache' to access file name of already loaded element.

   Objects in 'Cache' containers are stored using 'Memx' container,
      which means that the memory address of the elements remains constant as long as the elements exist.

   'Cache' loads the data and stores it forever (as long as the cache lives),
      in order to load the data for as long as it is needed, you must use 'CacheElmPtr'.

   'CacheElmPtr' can be treated like a typical pointer, with the exception that when copied or destroyed,
      it automatically increases/decreses the reference count of an element inside a cache.
      Once the reference count of an element drops to zero, it means that there are no more 'CacheElmPtr'
      pointers referencing the data, and the data is released.

   Engine uses the 'Cache' class to store many types of data, for example:
      'Images'    - cache for images   , with 'ImagePtr'    typedef for the 'CacheElmPtr' template pointer
      'Materials' - cache for materials, with 'MaterialPtr' typedef for the 'CacheElmPtr' template pointer
      'Meshes'    - cache for meshes   , with 'MeshPtr'     typedef for the 'CacheElmPtr' template pointer
      ..
